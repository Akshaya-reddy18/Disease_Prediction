# Infection Expectation Framework
<br>
-> This framework is intended to anticipate the probability of four sorts of infections: **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, **Parkinson's Disease**, and **PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)**.
<br>
-> The framework is constructed utilizing crude information given by the association, which is utilized to prepare AI models. These models are then used to foresee the event of infections in light of client inputs.
<br>
-> To get exact expectations, clients should give exact information values comparing to their experimental outcomes. The framework use famous Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn** to handle information and produce expectations.
<br>
-> The accompanying modules and their particular variants are utilized to run the forecast framework:
<br>
<pre>
      numpy - 1.26.4
      pandas - 2.2.3
      pickle - 0.7.5
      sklearn - 1.6.1
      streamlit - 1.37.1
      streamlit_option_menu - 0.4.0
</pre>
<br>
-> The primary document to execute the expectation module is **'web.py'**. The prepared AI models are put away in the **'MODELS'** envelope, while the information preprocessing and taking care of rationale are dealt with by documents situated in the **'MODULES'** organizer.
<br>
-> This framework gives an instinctive and easy to use interface for infection expectation, making it available for both clinical experts and people looking for wellbeing experiences.
